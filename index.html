      <h3>How to meditate on the Mysteries</h3>
      <p>As you pray each Hail Mary, focus on the Mystery, visualizing the scene and reflecting on its meaning. Let each bead draw you deeper:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visualize:</strong> Imagine yourself present at the event, noticing details.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflect:</strong> Consider the emotions of Mary and Jesus, and what God reveals.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply:</strong> Ask how this Mystery speaks to your life today and what virtue it inspires.</li>
      </ul>
